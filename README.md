# DoaFacil
Doa FÃ¡cil is a mobile application developed as part of the Professional Aptitude Test (PAP) at the Ruiz Costa Professional School (ERC).
The main objective is to connect food donors with people in vulnerable situations, facilitating quick and direct donations based on users' geographic locations.
The platform promotes solidarity, reduces food waste, and encourages community participation.

The application acts as an intermediary between donors and beneficiaries, allowing the creation, viewing, and requesting of donations in an intuitive and secure manner.
Developed for Android, it uses modern technologies to ensure scalability and accessibility.

# Main Features
